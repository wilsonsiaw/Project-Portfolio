# **ROCK PAPER SCISSORS**

## **Introduction**
This is my implementation of the popular game rock-paper-scissors.Traditionally the game is played by 2 "in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand", according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).

## **Gameplay**
The game is played by clicking any of the rock, paper or scissors buttons. The user (player) plays against the computer (machine) in this implementation.

After each click of the button, text is displayed indicating if the user or computer won that round of the game or if the round ended in a tie.

After the text has been displayed, a score is displayed on the score board. The score is calculated based on who won the particular round of the game with each round won being given 1 point.
