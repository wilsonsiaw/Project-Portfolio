**00 Landing Page**

In this project I build a landing page based on a mock-up I have been given.
The mockup image can be found here:

The landing page consists of 4 main sections and a footer. 

To re-create the mockup, I built the basic structure of the page using HTML,
then I used to CSS to style it. Beyond that I also used CSS Flexbox to position items on the page.
